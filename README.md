# Discord Verification Bot
Little bot that i made for a project, nothing crazy.

It works by clicking a button and the bot sends you a DM asking you the code. If your answer is right it adds a role to the person that solved the Verification.

(todo: add images/video demonstration)
## Installation
- Install [python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) depending on your OS.
- Install the discord.py library using **pip** in your terminal of choice.
```bash
pip install discord.py
```
- Clone/download this repo (or just the main.py file).
- Open the main.py file with your editor of choice and fill the discord bot token, the code, the channel, the message and the role ID.
- Run the main.py file with python.
```bash
python main.py
```
- Add the bot to the server, using the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications) and make sure that the permissions are right.
- Congrats you are done, run `!setup` on your channel and you are ready to go.
  
You can also hot this bot on other services like [Replit](https://replit.com) but most of them are really limited and i highly suggest you to self-host the bot (it's easy and you don't need powerful hardware).
